# Session slides and demo scripts from PowerShell Conference EU, 2017

## COMING SOON! Session slides, demo code and video links!

**Note to Speakers**: Please add a folder with your name and put your session content inside that, putting the demos for a single session into a .zip file. One of us (Ravikanth or Amanda) will update the table after we accept your pull request. If you'd prefer, give us a shout and we'll upload it for you :)
